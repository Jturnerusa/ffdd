* ffdd

This is a ~dd~ like utility, intended for writing images directly to block devices, especially flash based devices such as SD cards.

Unlike ~dd~, this utility only writes the blocks that differ, rather than writing the entire file, which can improve performance and reduce wear on flash based media.

* usage

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo ffdd --block-size=4192304 --in-file=$HOME/downloads/iso --out-file=/dev/sdX
#+END_SRC
